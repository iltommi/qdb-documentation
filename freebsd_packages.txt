Required FreeBSD packages
-------------------------

You will need the following packages to use wrpme on your FreeBSD system:

    - tbb 3.0 or later
    - gcc 4.6.0 or later

You can review your installed packages with the "pkg_info" command.

If you want to install the latest version of a package, for example tbb,
the typical command is:

    pkg_add -r tbb

If you want to build the nginx module, you will need nginx 0.7 or later 
and all required libraries. Check the nginx documentation for further 
information.
