Contacting Support
==================

Before contacting support, please prepare the following information:

 #. What version of quasardb are you running?
 #. Have you completed all installation steps for your operating system?
      * :doc:`administration/installation_windows`
      * :doc:`administration/installation_deb`
      * :doc:`administration/installation_rpm`
      * :doc:`administration/installation_other_linux`
      * :doc:`administration/installation_freebsd`
      * :doc:`administration/installation_docker`
 #. What is the output of the qdbd log file?

Once you have collected this information, send it in an email to `support@quasardb.net <support@quasardb.net>`_. It will automatically be submitted to the quality assurance team. If additional information is required to work on your issue, the team will get back to you.

All bug reports are read, even from users without a support plan. However, keep in mind that users with a support plan have a higher processing priority.
