**quasardb** - a creation of  `Quasardb SAS <http://www.quasardb.net>`_  - is a high-performance, non-relational database designed from the ground up for the most demanding environments.

If you are new to **quasardb** the :doc:`primer` is a good introduction. The :doc:`faq` may also have the information you are looking for.

Should you need a step by step guide to install and use your first cluster, we have two detailed tutorials in the :doc:`tutorials/index` chapter.

For specific information regarding the usage or the administration of a **quasardb** component, please read the :doc:`reference/index`. All the information related to development is in the :doc:`api/index` chapter.

Is this documentation helpful? Let us know! (see :doc:`contact`).
