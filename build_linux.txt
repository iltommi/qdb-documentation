BUILDING WRPME! ON LINUX
--------------------------

You need root privileges to install the libraries and utilities below.

1/INSTALL G++ 4.6
-----------------

You will need to get a gcc-snapshot and build it.

2/INSTALL TBB
-------------

TBB is available as a port. TBB 2.2 or later is required.

sudo apt-get install libtbb-dev

make 
make install

3/INSTALL CMAKE
---------------

CMake is available as a package. CMake 2.8 or later is required.

apt-get install cmake


4/INSTALL AUTOCONF AND AUTOMAKE
-------------------------------

If you haven't installed autoconf and automake, you will have to do it in order to build the Protobuf library.

They are both available as a package.


apt-get install automake
apt-get install autoconf


5/BUILD AND INSTALL BOOST
-------------------------

apt-get install libboost1.40-dev
apt-get install libboost-filesystem1.40-dev
apt-get install libboost-program-options1.40-dev
apt-get install libboost-thread1.40-dev
apt-get install libboost-test1.40-dev


It is highly recommended to download the latest version of Boost and build them on your machine with the right version of G++.

Boost 1.43.0 or later is required.

To build boost make sure you have expat and MPI installed.

Get the latest release here : http://www.boost.org/

Unpack the release and run cmake in the boost root dir with the right compiler option, e.g. for G++ 4.4

In the Boost directory you just unpacked:

 cmake . -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-46 -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc-46

Then run 

 make
 make modules
 make install
 
6/BUILD AND INSTALL PROTOBUF
----------------------------

apt-get install libprotobuf3

As for Boost, it is recommended to build and install protobuf manually, although it's available as a port.

ProtoBuf 2.2.0 or later is required.

Get the lateste release here: http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/

You will need autoconf and automake installed.

Set the following variables to match your compiler CC and CXX.

For example in csh:

 set CC = gcc44
 set CXX = g++44

In the protobuf directory run:

 ./configure
 make
 make install
