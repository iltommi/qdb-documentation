BUILDING WRPME! ON FREEBSD
--------------------------

You need root privileges to install the libraries and utilities below.

1/INSTALL G++ 4.6
-----------------

G++ 4.6 or later is required. You can get a snapshot from the ports collection.

2/INSTALL TBB
-------------

TBB is available as a port. TBB 2.2 or later is required.

cd /usr/ports/devel/tbb

make 
make install

3/INSTALL CMAKE
---------------

CMake is available as a package. CMake 2.6 or later is required.

To add the package on your machine simply do the following 

pkg_add -r ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/amd64/packages-7.2-release/All/cmake-2.6.3.tbz

4/INSTALL AUTOCONF AND AUTOMAKE
-------------------------------

If you haven't installed autoconf and automake, you will have to do it in order to build the Protobuf library.

They are both available as a package.

For example, in FreeBSD 7.2 :

pkg_add -r ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/amd64/packages-7.2-release/All/autoconf-2.13.000227_6.tbz
pkg_add -r ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/amd64/packages-7.2-release/All/automake-1.9.6_3.tbz

5/BUILD AND INSTALL BOOST
-------------------------

It is highly recommended to download the latest version of Boost and build them on your machine with the right version of G++.

Boost 1.43.0 or later is required.

Get the latest release here : http://www.boost.org/

Unpack the release and run cmake in the boost root dir with the right compiler option, e.g. for G++ 4.6

In the Boost directory you just unpacked:

 cmake . -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++46 -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc46

Then run 

 make
 make modules
 make install
 
6/BUILD AND INSTALL PROTOBUF
----------------------------

As for Boost, it is recommended to build and install protobuf manually, although it's available as a port.

ProtoBuf 2.2.0 or later is required.

Get the latest release here: http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/

You will need autoconf and automake installed.

Set the following variables to match your compiler CC and CXX.

For example in csh:

 set CC = gcc46
 set CXX = g++46

In the protobuf directory run:

 ./configure
 make
 make install
